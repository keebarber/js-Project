Project goal was to create RPG-esque battle simulater which pits the user against the Grand Circus Detroit mascot, Grant Chirpus.

Build Rules were to implement battle data to the UI and to use buttons to track user input and decisions. 

User begins with 40 health, has 1 life, does 1-3 damage each hit, and can use up to 2 potions which restore a random amount of health (1-10).
CPU (Grant Chirpus) ha 10 health, 3 lives, does 1-5 damage each hit, and has no potions. 

The battle ends if the user chooses to run away, when the user loses all their health, or when they have defeated Grant 3 times. 

Project was built over approx. 1 week.
